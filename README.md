  ```
  The README generator requires the installation of Node.js. Users must also have access to a command line interface (VS code terminal/Gitbash) in order to run Node. Inquirer npm must also be installed (npm i inquirer@8.2.4)
  ```
  
  ## Usage
  
  In order to use the README generator, open the VS code terminal and ensure you are linked to the correct file. Type "node index.js" in the terminal and answer the prompts. Once the prompts have been amswered, open the new README.md created in the current working directory and preview the README. The code is set up to create a new README file based on the project title provided by the user.
